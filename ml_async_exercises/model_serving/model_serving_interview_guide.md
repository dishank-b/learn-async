# ML Model Serving Async Interview Guide

## Exercise Overview

This interview exercise focuses on optimizing a model serving system that handles inference requests. The candidate is given a synchronous implementation and asked to convert it to an async approach to improve throughput and latency.

**Scenario**: The application serves ML models by:
1. Loading models from disk or a cache
2. Running inference on input data
3. Returning predictions
4. Processing multiple requests concurrently

**Time allocation**: ~15 minutes

## Interview Script

### Introduction (1-2 minutes)

"Today we'll be looking at a model serving system. Model serving is a critical component in ML infrastructure where we need to efficiently handle inference requests in real-time.

You're given a synchronous implementation of a model server that loads models and runs inference. This works fine for a few requests, but scales poorly as request volume increases.

Your task is to reimplement this using async techniques to improve throughput and latency. Pay special attention to:
1. Concurrent request processing
2. Efficient model loading with caching
3. Handling potential race conditions"

### Coding Phase (10 minutes)

1. Let the candidate review the code for 1-2 minutes
2. Ask them to explain their approach before they start coding
3. Watch their implementation, noting:
   - Do they recognize the model loading bottleneck?
   - Do they implement proper concurrency controls?
   - Can they handle batched processing efficiently?

### Guiding Questions & Hints

If the candidate gets stuck, use these progressive hints:

1. First hint: "Consider what happens when multiple requests need the same model. How can you prevent duplicate model loads?"
   - Expected answer: Use a lock per model to prevent multiple concurrent loads of the same model

2. Second hint: "In real ML systems, inference can be CPU-bound. How would you handle this in an async context?"
   - Expected answer: Use run_in_executor to move CPU-intensive work to a thread pool

3. Third hint: "How can you efficiently process multiple requests that need different models?"
   - Expected answer: Create tasks for each request and use asyncio.gather

4. Fourth hint: "Think about resource management. How would you ensure the server doesn't get overloaded?"
   - Expected answer: Implement concurrency limits with semaphores or throttling

### Solution Walkthrough

When they've finished (or if time is up), walk through the solution:

1. **Basic structure** required:
   - Async class with methods for loading models and running inference
   - Lock mechanism to prevent duplicate model loads
   - Concurrent request processing
   - Proper error handling

2. **Key points** to highlight:
   - Using `asyncio.Lock()` to prevent race conditions in model loading
   - Efficiently reusing cached models
   - Concurrent processing of different requests
   - In real systems, using executors for CPU-bound work

3. **Expected performance**: The async implementation should be much faster for batches of requests, especially when there's model reuse across requests.

### Evaluation Criteria

Strong candidates will:
- Implement proper concurrency controls for model loading
- Recognize the difference between I/O-bound and CPU-bound operations
- Handle error cases gracefully
- Explain tradeoffs in their implementation
- Consider resource constraints and overload scenarios
- Complete the solution within time constraints

### Follow-up Questions (3 minutes)

1. "How would you handle models that are too large to fit in memory all at once?"
   - Good answer: Implement a cache eviction policy based on usage patterns, LRU, or model priority

2. "What would change if the inference requests had different priorities?"
   - Good answer: Add a priority queue for requests and process high-priority requests first

3. "How would you make this system more resilient to failures?"
   - Good answer: Add retries, health checks, and fallback models or predictions

## Common Applications of Async in ML Serving Systems

Share these after the exercise:

1. **High-throughput Inference APIs**: Handling many concurrent requests efficiently
2. **Model Ensembles**: Gathering predictions from multiple models concurrently
3. **Feature Computation**: Fetching and computing features in parallel
4. **Streaming Inference**: Processing continuous data streams with backpressure
5. **Multi-stage Pipelines**: Coordinating preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing
6. **Dynamic Batching**: Grouping incoming requests into optimal batches
7. **Adaptive Scaling**: Adjusting concurrency based on load patterns
8. **A/B Testing**: Sending requests to multiple model versions for comparison

This exercise demonstrates patterns used in real-world ML serving systems, where latency and throughput directly impact user experience and system performance.
