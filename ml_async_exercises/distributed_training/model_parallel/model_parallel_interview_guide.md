# Model Parallel Training Interview Guide

## Exercise Overview

This interview exercise focuses on implementing an asynchronous model-parallel neural network training system with efficient pipelining. The candidate is given a synchronous implementation and asked to optimize it using async techniques.

**Scenario**: The application simulates model-parallel training where:
1. Different layers of a neural network run on different compute nodes
2. Forward pass requires passing activations from one node to the next
3. Backward pass requires passing gradients back in reverse order
4. Multiple batches need to be processed efficiently through the pipeline

**Time allocation**: ~15 minutes

## Interview Script

### Introduction (1-2 minutes)

"Today we'll be exploring model parallelism, a key technique in distributed deep learning where different parts of a neural network are distributed across multiple compute nodes.

The current implementation processes each training batch sequentially through all the layer nodes. This means we wait for a batch to completely finish its forward and backward passes before starting the next batch, which is inefficient.

Your task is to implement an asynchronous pipelined version where multiple batches can be in-flight simultaneously. This is similar to how TPU pod training works at Google or how NVIDIA's pipeline parallelism operates."

### Coding Phase (10 minutes)

1. Let the candidate review the code for 1-2 minutes
2. Ask them to explain their approach before they start coding
3. Watch their implementation, noting:
   - Do they understand the pipelining concept?
   - Can they manage dependencies between nodes correctly?
   - Do they handle the coordination challenges?

### Guiding Questions & Hints

If the candidate gets stuck, use these progressive hints:

1. First hint: "What's the key insight that allows multiple batches to be processed simultaneously?"
   - Expected answer: Different nodes can work on different batches at the same time

2. Second hint: "How will you track which activations belong to which batch?"
   - Expected answer: Need a data structure to map batch IDs to their activations

3. Third hint: "What happens if two batches try to use the same node at the same time?"
   - Expected answer: Need locks or semaphores to prevent resource contention

4. Fourth hint: "How can you limit the number of in-flight batches to prevent memory issues?"
   - Expected answer: Use a semaphore to control pipeline depth

### Solution Walkthrough

When they've finished (or if time is up), walk through the solution:

1. **Basic structure** required:
   - Convert node methods to async
   - Implement pipeline batch tracking
   - Add proper coordination between nodes
   - Control maximum pipeline depth

2. **Key points** to highlight:
   - Using locks to prevent node contention
   - Tracking activations per batch
   - Limiting pipeline depth with a semaphore
   - Managing the forward/backward dependency chain
   - True asynchronous execution of the pipeline

3. **Expected performance**: The async implementation should be significantly faster due to better hardware utilization through pipelining.

### Evaluation Criteria

Strong candidates will:
- Implement proper batch tracking across nodes
- Create an effective pipelining mechanism
- Handle node resource contention
- Understand the performance implications of their design
- Discuss pipeline efficiency trade-offs
- Complete the solution within time constraints

### Follow-up Questions (3 minutes)

1. "What are the memory implications of your pipelined solution?"
   - Good answer: Memory usage increases with pipeline depth; need to balance throughput vs. memory

2. "How would you handle dynamic batch sizes in this system?"
   - Good answer: Track batch dimensions explicitly, adjust computation accordingly, perhaps normalize resource use

3. "In a real system, how would you balance pipeline stages to maximize throughput?"
   - Good answer: Measure node execution times, redistribute work to balance stages, consider model partitioning strategies

## Common Applications of Async in Model Parallel Training

Share these after the exercise:

1. **Pipeline Parallelism**: Efficient processing of mini-batches through model stages
2. **Activation Recomputation**: Coordinating memory-saving techniques in large models
3. **Cross-Node Communication**: Optimizing data transfer between compute nodes
4. **Tensor Partitioning**: Managing sharded operations across devices
5. **Asynchronous Gradient Accumulation**: Allowing nodes to proceed at different rates
6. **Bubble Reduction**: Techniques to minimize pipeline stalls
7. **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Adapting to varying compute node performance
8. **Zero Redundancy Optimizer**: Coordinating distributed optimizer state

This exercise demonstrates principles used in real-world model parallel systems like GPipe, PipeDream, Megatron-LM, and DeepSpeed.
