# ML Data Pipeline Async Interview Guide

## Exercise Overview

This interview exercise focuses on optimizing a data pipeline for ML training. The candidate is given a synchronous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implementation and asked to convert it to use async programming for better performance.

**Scenario**: The application needs to:
1. Download datasets from multiple API endpoints
2. Process each dataset with CPU-bound operations
3. Combine the processed datasets into a final dataset for ML training
4. Handle caching for efficiency

**Time allocation**: ~15 minutes

## Interview Script

### Introduction (1-2 minutes)

"Today we're looking at a common ML engineering scenario: data pipeline optimization. You have a Python script that implements an ETL pipeline for gathering training data from multiple sources. Currently, it's doing everything sequentially, which is inefficient.

Your task is to reimplement this using async programming to make the pipeline faster. I've provided a synchronous implementation to get you started. Pay particular attention to:
1. Making network operations concurrent
2. Handling disk I/O operations asynchronously
3. Properly managing CPU-bound processing tasks"

### Coding Phase (10 minutes)

1. Let the candidate review the code for 1-2 minutes
2. Ask them to explain their approach before they start coding
3. Watch their implementation, noting:
   - Do they distinguish between I/O-bound and CPU-bound operations?
   - Can they use asyncio properly for file operations?
   - Do they structure the solution with proper error handling?

### Guiding Questions & Hints

If the candidate gets stuck, use these progressive hints:

1. First hint: "Consider which operations are I/O-bound versus CPU-bound. Which will benefit most from async?"
   - Expected answer: Network downloads and file operations (I/O-bound) benefit most, while data processing operations (CPU-bound) need special handling

2. Second hint: "How would you handle file operations asynchronously? The standard open() is blocking."
   - Expected answer: Use aiofiles library for async file operations

3. Third hint: "For CPU-bound operations like data processing, what's the best approach in asyncio?"
   - Expected answer: Use run_in_executor to move CPU-bound work to a thread pool

4. Fourth hint: "When downloading multiple datasets concurrently, what's the best way to manage connections?"
   - Expected answer: Use a shared aiohttp.ClientSession for connection pooling

### Solution Walkthrough

When they've finished (or if time is up), walk through the solution:

1. **Basic structure** required:
   - Async functions for downloading, processing, and combining datasets
   - Proper session management for HTTP requests
   - Concurrent execution using gather or tasks
   - Async file I/O with aiofiles

2. **Key points** to highlight:
   - `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent downloads and processing
   - Using aiohttp for async HTTP requests
   - Using aiofiles for async file operations
   - For CPU-bound tasks in real scenarios, would use executor pools

3. **Expected performance**: The async implementation should be significantly faster than the synchronous version, especially as the number of data sources increases.

### Evaluation Criteria

Strong candidates will:
- Properly distinguish between I/O-bound and CPU-bound operations
- Use appropriate async libraries (aiohttp, aiofiles)
- Implement proper error handling and resource management
- Structure the code clearly with well-defined async functions
- Discuss the limitations of async for CPU-bound work
- Complete the solution within time constraints

### Follow-up Questions (3 minutes)

1. "What would you do differently if the processing step was very CPU-intensive?"
   - Good answer: Use run_in_executor with a ProcessPoolExecutor to leverage multiple CPU cores

2. "How would you handle rate-limiting if some of the data sources had API limits?"
   - Good answer: Implement semaphores to limit concurrent requests to specific endpoints

3. "What monitoring would you add to this pipeline in production?"
   - Good answer: Track time for each stage, implement retries, log failures, monitor memory usage

## Common Applications of Async in ML Data Pipelines

Share these after the exercise:

1. **Feature Engineering Pipelines**: Concurrent extraction of features from multiple data sources
2. **Dataset Preprocessing**: Parallel downloading and transforming data files
3. **Distributed Dataset Sharding**: Coordinating dataset splitting across multiple workers
4. **Online Feature Stores**: Fetching features from multiple services with low latency
5. **Data Validation**: Running multiple validation checks in parallel
6. **Incremental Training**: Streaming new data while model training continues
7. **Data Augmentation**: Processing multiple augmented samples concurrently

This exercise tests patterns that apply across various ML data engineering scenarios, where improving data pipeline throughput directly affects training efficiency.
